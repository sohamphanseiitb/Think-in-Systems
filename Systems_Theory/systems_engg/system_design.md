# Systems Engineering is great, but how do they do it?

Valid question, if you expect a short but sweet answer: some standardized procedures combined with lots of experiencce. A longer but detailed answer? Well, keep reading. 

So there are a lot of standardized procedures and models which come in handy to design, conceptualize, deploy and retire real world systems. One of the most common yet powerful methods is called the **V-model** approach. It might sound daunting, but believe me, its simple and quite intuitive. Check out the snippet below, it details the procedures carried out in a particular sequence, which resembles the letter **V.**. 

The left arm signifies the problem breakdown procedure - defining the problem statement, enlisting requirements, expanding the design space and converging onto a single solution along with the high level design and architecture. The base signifies the design process - designing components, parts, sub-assemblies, assemblies and then eventually the whole system. The right arm tests and integrates the whole system from the parts. If you watch carefully, the **V** is divided into two parts - the upper section consider the demand side parameters while the lower section focusses on the designer's side. 

The process starts with defining the problem at hand - say, for instance, implementing a national railway transportation system, or constructing a dam for irrigation purposes, or as simple as desiging a lawnmover for farming and gardening.
