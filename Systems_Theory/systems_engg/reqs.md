# Requirements - Constraints to compress the solution space 

The last time we talked about identifying the problem and then ponder about different alternative solutions which can be implemented to solve the problem. This process in technical terms is called - expanding the solution space. Once we obtain a sizable population of solutions, we start applying different constraints to converge onto a single, most optimal solution. If you aren't exactly catching up with what I am saying, feel free to check the last article focussing on [initial system design](https://sohamphanseiitb.github.io/Think-in-Systems/Systems_Theory/systems_engg/system_design.html). Believe me, it's kinda hard to catch up systems theory at the begingging, but once you get used to it, you will start unravelling newer domains yourselves!

Cool, back to what we were talking, we now have an expanded design space, we now wish to converge to a single solution. For instance, take the passenger and goods transport system to be implemented in a city. The city baosts a large coastline and has an intricate network of rivulets, banks and canals. Lets assume that the city spans about 25 square kilometres. It measures about 5 kilometres in length as well as breadth (just assume). Hence the largest distance any passenger/cargo might want to travel is about 7~8 kms. (Pythagoras theorem, the diagonal is the largest in length in a square, :P). Let's assume that the local government wants to achieve rapid transport and wants even the farthest passengers reach their destinations within an hour or so. Now, that you ahve all this information, what mode of transport would you choose? Would you opt for constructing a network of ley lines and railcars, would it be a street car/bus system, or would it be waterways? Each one offers some advantages plus some drawbacks. If you choose to implement the waterways, you don't need to construct additional infrastructure expcet the docsk, because rivers are natural highways. On the other hand,
