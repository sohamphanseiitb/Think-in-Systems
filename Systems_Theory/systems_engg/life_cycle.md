# System Life Cycle

Deploying any system is not a simple deal. There are a lot of processes and decisions which go on into making a system operationally successful. In formal terms, these processes are called, 'System Life Cycle Phases'. Let's have a quick look at what these phases are:

- Concept Phase
- Development or Design phase
- Utilization Phase
- Maintainence Phase
- Retirement Phase

These are not at all difficult to understand. The concept stage is where the idea of the system is born. It consists all sorts of initial work, trying to find the problem, decisions on which part of the problem to address, proposing candidate solutions and shortlisting, solution implementation ideas. This is the phase where the foundation and overall plan of the system is laid. Estimates of cost, time to deploy and operate the system, maintainence plans are all conceptualized in this phase. It takes a significant amount of time in the lifetime of any system. 

Next, is the development phase. In this phase, we develop on the ideas, conceptualize their working, prove the hypotheses mathematically or with prototyping. This is where the system takes shape; from the crude idea to a refined product or service ready to perform flawlessly. All major design decisions are taken in this phase. Rigorous testing and validation is carried out for ensuring required performance and safety criteria.

Utilization phase is the deployment of the system on site. It is the final stage for the system designer, for after that the system ownership is transferred to the user as per the rules of the deal. Here is where the system realizes the goals and ends for what it was created. While operating, it is monitored well to ensure quick repairs and maintainence to reduce unoperational time and boost efficiency.
