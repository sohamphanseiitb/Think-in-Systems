# More on Systems

Let's see some more examples of systems to make the idea, clear and easy to understand. In the last post, we looked at a school or an university from a systems perspective. Now, lets take a cricket team, or for that matter any sport team. Can we dissect and analyze it from the Systems perspective, why not, lets try!

Lets first point out the function a sport team executes. It can be winning matches, pursuing one's passion, making the country proud or something as frugal as making money! The elements of the system consists of the players, coach, equipment and other auxiliary staff.

All these elements are inter-related in some way, the behavior of the system depends on how all of these elements are inter-connected and form a whole; the players' communications, coach's strategy, the laws of physics governing the motion of the ball and the bat, the sense of team bonding among the members. 

You must have by now, understood how we analyze systems in general, I would want that you apply the same type of analysis and identify to each of the following systems:
1. The e-ticketing system
2. The Traffic management system
3. Courier and Logistic system
4. The educational system (you are a part of)
