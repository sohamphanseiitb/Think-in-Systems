# What is a system?

Think about it – we often use the system countlessly many times in our daily lives, the e-ticketing system you use to plan and book tickets for your upcoming holiday, the traffic management system which manages the road traffic in your city, the public transportation system which you must have used to commute to college, work, and the education system which you are currently a part of among a large zoo of systems around us. 

It's surreal that we come across a countless number of systems in our lives, but our approach to looking towards them is local, based on a reductionist view, the cause-and-effect mentality, and not as a holistic picture. This blog aims to bridge this gap by intuitively explaining Systems Science in an undergraduate accessible manner and inculcate the habit of a holistic systems thinking in daily life. 

Getting back to describing a system – let's have a look at the definition first, 
> "System is a set of interacting components, coherently organized in such a way to bring out a characteristic behaviour, perform a function or satisfy a purpose."

Okay, I can understand; let's not try and gobble it all at once. Let's dissect it piece by piece. By, 'System is a set of interacting components' we mean, every system is made up of elements; they can be humans, plants, animals, or for that matter, even inanimate objects. All these together – but wait a minute, do these components form a system in isolation, don't they talk to each other? The answer is yes; the elements interact via physical flows, information exchange, and many different forms. 

But what exactly do these elements do by interacting – they perform a function or satisfy a purpose. And to ensure they do so, they are organized in a suitable way. To cement these concepts, let's take an example of your school or college – whose internet services you might be using right now, to read this page! :P

Let's start with what functions a school performs – the first thing that pops up in my head (at least) is 'Knowledge dissemination.' In a school, professors and senior students exchange and pass on their knowledge and experience to the juniors, which reciprocate the same, thus continuing the transfer of knowledge in newer generations of society. To accomplish this mission at hand, a school has some set of rules which govern academics, extra-curriculars, grading policies of students (which you hate the most, don't worry, same here! :P) and a host of a lot of other things. Students, professors, administration staff, laboratories, equipment, classrooms are the elements that make up the school system. And your relations with your professors, their teaching, grade allotment are just some of the ways these elements interact. 

And these elements, along with their inter-relations, or do I say inter-connections, behave in a particular way to perform the function of 'Knowledge Dissemination.'

Let me leave you at this point, try to think of examples which can be seen from the systems lens, we will look at some more exciting traits of systems, the next time I post!
