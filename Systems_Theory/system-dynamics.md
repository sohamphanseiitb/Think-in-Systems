# What is System Dynamics?

You must have by now realized that systems behave to stimuli, differently, based on the situation, time and on their inherent structure. Systems evolve with time, even though made of inanimate objects, they tend to learn to respond in the most optimal way and display dynamic and changing behavior. System Dynamics is a branch of systems theory which outlines the methods with which we can model the inherent structure of the system, to know more about how it works and make predictions based on hypothetical stimuli. 

Let's us take a simple example of how a country's population, or for that matter the world population behaves with time. To put this forward in an intuitive way, let me make use of a lot of block diagrams and illustrations, I will describe each of them as we go along! Lets get started.

To analyse how a system behaves with time, we usually use the so-called 'Stock' and 'Flow' diagrams. You can think of stocks as inventories or storehouses of any product, be it a car, a bicycle, or a living being. Flows can be of 2 types, sources and sinks. For a storehouse, source is the inflow of produce from the manufacturing units and sink is the outflow due to consumer demand, testing, market survey, etc. Let's analyse how a storehouse operates in different scenarios. 

Before that, here are some conventions which we will follow. The storehouse is our system and we intend to analyse its behavior. It is a 1 stock and 2 flow (inflow and outflow) system. Other than that, we have labor, capital, controllers and other elements to complete the system.
