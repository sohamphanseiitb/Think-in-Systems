# Feedback - Systems Way of Communication

A feedback loop is formed when changes in a stock affect the flows into or out of that samestock.  A feedback loop is some kind of a control mechanism that affects and gets affected bythe stock level at that point in time.  Feedback loops can cause stocks to maintain their levelwithin a range or grow or decline.  A feedback loop is a closed chain of causal connectionsfrom stock, through a set of decisions or rules or physical laws or actions that are dependenton the level of the stock, and back again through a flow to change the stock.  There are twokinds of loop - Balancing or Restoring and Reinforcing.

## Balancing Feedback Loop

This  feedback  tends  to  maintain  the  stock  at  some  level.   It  acts  as  a  restoring  force  orresistance to change in the stock level.  For instance take a ball inside a bowl, even if the ballis displaced a bit, it is restored to a position such that its gravitational potential energy isminimised.  A stock regulated with a balancing feedback loop remains instable  equilibriumand has the capacity to absorb shocks up to a certain threshold.

## Reinforcing Feedback Loop
This feedback tends to increase or decrease the stock level depending on the incident pertur-bation.  If the perturbation tends to increase the stock level, the feedback loop will reinforcethis  action  and  increase  the  stock  level  further and vice versa. A common  example is the stock of population, the higher the population, the higher the births which again causes thepopulation  to  increase.   This  reinforcing action causes the  population  stock  to  rise. Thesetype of system tend to exhibit unstable equilibrium behaviour.  If they are perturbed thendue to this reinforcing nature they cant be restored to their natural balanced state.

I think you must have by now how feedback work, it reacts to a certain quantity internal or external to the system and creates a response which tries to alter the level of the stock. In this example, take the stock as the potential energy of the ball, in the reinforcing feedback loop (inverted bowl) the decrease in potential energy of the ball stimulates the system which accelerates the ball in the direction of motion. This again leads to decrease in potential energy and this happens till the decrease is zero, i.e the ball becomes stable in the direction perpendicular to the direction of gravity (in this case).

Hope you are now familiar with the basics of Systems - Stocks, Flows and Feedbacks. In the next article, we will look at Causal Loop Diagrams, a nice and intuitive to graphically depict the system and gain useful insights. Hope you are enjoying!
