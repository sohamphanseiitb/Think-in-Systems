# Causal Loop Diagrams

A causal loop diagram is a visual representation of how the variables in the system interact andare related to each other.  The diagram consists of a set of nodes and edges.  Nodes representthe variables and edges are the links that represent a connection or a relation between thetwo variables.  A link marked positive indicates a positive relation and a link marked negativeindicates a negative relation.  A positive causal link means the two nodes change in the samedirection, i.e.  if the node in which the link starts decreases, the other node also decreases.

Causal Loop Diagrams is an excellent way to represent the internal structure and dynamics of the system. With all the tools like, **Stocks**, Flows, Feedbacks and Causal Loop Diagrams in our arsenal, let us try and analyse a simple one stock system in different scenarios to check how the system responds.
