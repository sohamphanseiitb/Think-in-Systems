# Think-in-Systems

Hello All, I am Soham Phanse, a third year Undergraduate from the Department of Aerospace Engineering. Over my years at IIT Bombay, I observed that there is a lack of a systems thinking perspective in undergraduates, and it is natural, becuase no such courses are offered in the Core curriculum. 

Keeping this end in view, I plan to blog about Systems Engineering and Dynamics and share my learnings from my work at the Student Satellite Program and a project work on System Dynamics which was recently awarded Undergraduate Research Award 01 by IIT Bombay. 

Find the blog live, here: [Think-in-Systems: An intuitive Introduction to Systems Engineering and Dynamics](https://sohamphanseiitb.github.io/Think-in-Systems/)
