# Think-in-Systems

Namaste everyone! Greetings from India!

I am Soham Phanse, a third year Undergraduate from the Department of Aerospace Engineering at IIT Bombay. Since joining IIT Bombay, I have observed a lack of systems thinking perspective towards engineering problems in undergraduates, which is completely is natural, because no such courses are offered in the Core curriculum. 

Keeping this end in view, I plan to blog about Systems Engineering and Dynamics and share my learnings from what I learnt through courses, project but more importantly by working at the Student Satellite Program. 

Find the blog live, here: [Think-in-Systems: An intuitive Introduction to Systems Engineering and Dynamics](https://sohamphanseiitb.github.io/Think-in-Systems/)
