## Hello World!
Namaste everyone! Greetings from India!

I am Soham Phanse, a third year Undergraduate from the Department of Aerospace Engineering at IIT Bombay. Since joining IIT Bombay, I have observed a lack of systems thinking perspective towards engineering problems in undergraduates, which is completely is natural, because no such courses are offered in the Core curriculum.

Keeping this end in view, I plan to blog about Systems Engineering and Dynamics and share my learnings from what I learnt through courses, project but more importantly by working at the [Student Satellite Program](https://www.aero.iitb.ac.in/satelliteWiki/index.php/Satellite_101). 

I have tried it to keep it as intuitive as possible, and keeping technical terms to a minimum. Not that I have compromised the technical details, but there already exist heavyily technical and in-depth reading resources on systems engineering. However, there is a steep dearth of articles accessible to Undergraduates. 

## My recommendation
I would recommend everyone to read this blog sequentially, don't directly jump over to advanced articles. The articles slowly build upon things and go upto a slightly advanced level. Feel free to drop me an email in case you want to discuss! That is all I want to mention, my best wishes to the readers! Happy Systems-Engineering!!
